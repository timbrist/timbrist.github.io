# Unreal Engine 5: 

Thanks for Crimson from his video [YOU'RE LEARNING UNREAL ENGINE 5 WRONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFR6BfySY7A). The idea of learning unreal engine is to treat it as different subjects as school curriculum. 

<!-- Please come back and refine the idea here-->
Here is the subject you need to know before creating a game: 

## Asset Creation
independent game developers often download and use pre-made art assets to build their games. 
- 3D Modeling: 
using 3D-modeling software like: Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max, UE5 Plugin(beta) to create model of characters, environments, and so on.
- Texturing and Materials: 
Develop textures and materials using tools like Substance Painter or Photoshop, and import them into UE5.
- Animation
Animate characters and objects, using UE5's built-in animation tools or importing animations from external software.
- Sounds:
Not in my plan.

## Programing
- Blueprint:  
prototype and implement gameplay mechanics
- C++ programing: 
For more complex functionalities
- AI and Behavior:
Develop AI behaviors using Behavior Trees and other AI tools available in UE5.

## Hello World 
Add a cube and move it move with blueprint and c++.
