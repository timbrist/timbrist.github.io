## Experience

### Research Assistant
**Aalto University**
*Espoo, Finland*
*June 2024 - August 2024*

- Developed a CARLA autonomous driving agent using large language models like LLama2, GPT4o.
- Developed a natural language narrations and reasoning for driving dataset from [BDD-X-dataset](https://github.com/JinkyuKimUCB/BDD-X-dataset), using GPT4o
- Implement and finetuning the state-of-art method on BDD-X-dataset on [videollava](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-LLaVA)
- Design experiments and evaluate results on metrics like BLUE, CIDEr.

### Summer Trainee
**University of Jyväskylä**
*Jyväskylä, Finland*
*April 2023 - August 2023*

- Developed an interpreter of Multi-objective optimization problems for group framework [DESDEO](https://github.com/industrial-optimization-group/DESDEO).

- Implement a web interface using Typescript, CortexJS library. It provides users to type multi-objective optimization problems in mathematic symbols and use DESDEO features. 

- Wrote unit tests to ensure all the [multi-objective optimization problems](https://desdeo-problem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) work correctly.


### Game Developer
**Shanghai CloudToad Network Technology Co., Ltd.**
*Shanghai, China*
*August 2021 - July 2022*

- Developed scout, equipment system on SLG mobile game using Unity, Lua, and C++. 
- Developed a data error checking game tool(using VB) for game designer. 
- Participated in code reviews and contributed to Git and SVN management. 
- Bug-fixing and Documentation. 

### Software Engineer
**TIANMA MICROELECTRONICS CO., LTD.**
*Shanghai, China*
*July 2020 - August 2021*

- Developed hibernate and wake-up, backlight dimming, transmission of touch data, and power management on automotive display/screen.
- 
    I was responsible for automotive display/screen products development. My tasks included requirement analysis, architecture design, implementation, and bug fixing. The software runs on an ARM Cortex M0/M4 which controls peripheral chips such as the Deserializer of MAX9278 and Touch control of Synaptics TB7800. I was involved in the implementation of a real-time operating system, which included serial communication with an automotive central control system. The main functions of the system included Hibernate and Wake-up, Backlight dimming, transmission of touch data, and power management.

July 2019 - December 2019
:  **Python, C++, Software Engineer Internship**: Shanghai WenShang Technology CO., LTD(China)

    Using image algorithms to detect flaws of industrial components. Optimizing the time complexity of the company image analyzing program. Documenting the results of software testing. Writing data analysis scripts to track detection data and parameters.


Education
---------

2022-2024 (expected)
:   **MSc, Cognitive Computing**: University of Jyväskylä (Finland)
    
    *Thesis: Autonomous Driving Systems with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study of Interpretability and Motion Planning* 
    
    Corroborated with Aalto University, we investigate the integration of large language models into autonomous driving systems, with a particular emphasis on their potential to enhance interpretability, decision-making, and planning capabilities. We implement both data-driven and knowledge-driven models within the CARLA simulator across diverse scenarios, focusing specifically on the TransFuser and LMDrive frameworks. 

2016-2020
:  **BSc, Software Engineering**: Shanghai Institute of Technology(China)
    
    *Thesis: 3D reconstruction with Structure Light.*

    I implemented a non-contact 3D surface measurement technique using OpenCV and a 3D reconstruction algorithm.The target object was projected by 6 gray codes and 4 phase patterns.I also designed and implemented an algorithm that matches feature points of right and left camera images within a reasonable time. The code is available as open source on [github](https://github.com/timbrist/structure-light).

Projects
--------------------

[Hikvision-qt](https://github.com/timbrist/hikvision-qt)  
I designed and implemented a Qt interface for Hikvison camera MV-CA013-21UM. It is a byproduct of my dissertation. I used Hikvison cameras mainly for taking pictures instantly while projecting project patterns.

Home Service Robot Competition  
I worked closely with hardware engineers for building a robot. My tasks were related to the software side which involved using C# to implement the robot's main logic, such as Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, and communication with ROS that are used for broadcasting messages to the robot chassis and laser. My team won 6 prizes at RoboCup (China Region), including 3 The First Prizes, and 9 prizes at China Service Robot Competition.
