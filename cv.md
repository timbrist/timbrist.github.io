## About
A software developer with a strong math(Machine Learning) and computer science background. I have 2 years of work experience and good-quality personal projects in C++. Twice full-time internship to tackle academic problems in Python. I believe my background in software development, deep learning, and my passion for optimizing AI applications will contribute to the industry. 

Education
---------

2022-2024 (expected)
:   **MSc, Cognitive Computing**: University of Jyv채skyl채 (Finland)
    <!-- *Thesis title: Finnish Exercise generation* -->
    Currently, I am writing the thesis with Aalto Univerity of the topic on "autonomous driving with large language model".

2016-2020
:  **BSc, Software Engineering**: Shanghai Institute of Technology(China)
    *Thesis: 3D reconstruction with Structure Light.*

    I implemented a non-contact 3D surface measurement technique using OpenCV and a 3D reconstruction algorithm.The target object was projected by 6 gray codes and 4 phase patterns.I also designed and implemented an algorithm that matches feature points of right and left camera images within a reasonable time. The code is available as open source on [github](https://github.com/timbrist/structure-light).

Experience
----------

April 2023 - September 2023
:   **Python, Summer Trainee**: University of Jyv채skyl채 (Finland)
    In The Multiobjective Optimization Group, I implemented a Lisp-like interpreter for users to create multiobjective optimization problems. The problem is described in a Json Format according to the structure suggested by the CortexJS library. The interpreter converts mathematical notation from Json to expressions that can be read by some Python libraries as polars and numpy.

August 2021 - July 2022
:  **C++, Software Engineer**: Shanghai CloudToad Network Technology Co., Ltd.,(China)
    I worked closely with game designers and artists. My main tasks were to build, refactor and maintain an SLG mobile game both on the client and server-side which allowed millions of players to interact on a large map. I designed and implemented a data error checking game tool for Game Numerical Designer. The game was driven by data stored in excel tables which later transformed into a .csv file that can be read by Lua and C++.
July 2020 - August 2021
:  **C, Software Engineer**: TIANMA MICROELECTRONICS CO., LTD.,(China)
    I was responsible for Automotive Display/screen products development. My tasks included requirement analysis, architecture design, implementation, and bug fixing. The software runs onan ARM Cortex M0/M4 which controls peripheral chips such as the Deserializer of MAX9278 and Touch control of Synaptics TB7800. I was involved in the implementation of a real-time operating system, which included serial communication with an automotive central control system. The main functions of the system included Hibernate and Wake-up, Backlight dimming, transmission of touch data, and power management.
July 2019 - December 2019
:  **Python,C++, Software Engineer Internship**: Shanghai WenShang Technology CO., LTD(China)
    Using image algorithms to detect flaws of industrial components. Optimizing the time complexity of the company image analyzing program. Documenting the results of software testing. Writing data analysis scripts to track detection data and parameters.

Projects
--------------------

[Hikvision-qt](https://github.com/timbrist/hikvision-qt)
:  I designed and implemented a Qt interface for Hikvison camera MV-CA013-21UM. It is a byproduct of my dissertation. I used Hikvison cameras mainly for taking pictures instantly while projecting project patterns.This project has 33 stars on github.

Competition: Home Service Robot Competition
:   I worked closely with hardware engineers for building a robot. My tasks were related to the software side which involved using C# to implement the robot's main logic, such as Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, and communication with ROS that are used for broadcasting messages to the robot chassis and laser. My team won 6 prizes at RoboCup (China Region), including 3 The First Prizes, and 9 prizes at China Service Robot Competition.
